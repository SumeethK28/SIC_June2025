+ and - has least precedence   (Performs operation from left to right)
* / // % has higher precedence
** has highest precedence  (Performs operation from right to left)

Octal -> 8 bits (0 to 7)
Hexadecimal -> 16 bits (0 to 15)
Binary -> 2 bits (0 & 1)

NOTE: There is no Function Overloading in Python.

Python uses Augmented Assignment Operators instead of Increment and Decrement Operators (++ or --) 
REASON:
	For better Readability
	Less prone to errors and avoids unwanted Complexity.
	Integers are Immutable, i.e., when the values in a variable are changed, even the memory address also changes.
	
Assignments on Loops
1. Find biggest digit in a number
2. Find 2nd smallest digit in a number
3. Count number of Prime digits in a number
4. Print the Prime numbers in decreasing order between m and n (m < n)
5. Find the Nth Fibo (HemaChandra) term. Assume 1st 2 terms are 1 and 2
6. Find sum of thye series n - n2/3 + n4/5 - n8/7 .... m terms (1<=n<=4 and 2<=m<=10)
7. Print the following shapes by accepting number of lines

B. Equi lateral Triangle
C. Hollow Square
D. howllow Rhombus
E. Pascal's Triangle
F. X shape
G. X shape inside hollow Square
H. Benzene Ring (C6H6) Hexagon

Accessing the array elements is also known as lookup which has O(1) because it uses address arithmetic operation to access elements.
