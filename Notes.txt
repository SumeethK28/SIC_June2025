NOTE: There is no Function Overloading in Python.

Python uses Augmented Assignment Operators instead of Increment and Decrement Operators (++ or --) 
REASON:
	For better Readability
	Less prone to errors and avoids unwanted Complexity.
	Integers are Immutable, i.e., when the values in a variable are changed, even the memory address also changes.
